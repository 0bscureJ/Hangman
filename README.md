Hangman Game!
First of many projects to come.
To play Hangman, download the Hangman.java and WordList.txt files. Open terminal and change directory to the location of these
files (usually under download: cd Downloads). Then type: "javac Hangman.java" and "java Hangman" without quotes to start the game!
